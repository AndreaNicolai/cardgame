# cardgame
javascript tutorial

Andrea Nicolai

This is a videogame based on players' memory, simply you need to click on the 5 same cards, there's also a score, to win so you have to turn over the same cards 5 times so you'll have 5 points and win the game!
When the game will finish you'll have to refresh the game(if you want to play it again) and the cards will have a different order so that won't be that easy!
